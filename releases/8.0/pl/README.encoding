Pages are encoded in ISO-8859-2.

&bdquo; and &rdquo; are Polish quote characters (",," and "''").
If entities are not desired, standard >>"<< in place of them.

I changed the encoding from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-2 since browsers
seem to use ISO-8859-1 fonts and "stuck in" ISO-8859-2 when
necessary; which looks rather ugly.  Having ISO-8859-2 encoding
explicitly does seem to help.
