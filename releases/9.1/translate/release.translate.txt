12 SEPTEMBER 2011: The PostgreSQL Global Development Group announces the release of PostgreSQL 9.1. This latest version of the leading open source database offers new features, innovative technology, and extensibility such as synchronous replication, K-Nearest Neighbor indexing, and foreign data wrappers.

“PostgreSQL 9.1 provides some of the most advanced enterprise capabilities of any open source database, and is backed by a vibrant and innovative community with proven customer success. PostgreSQL is well positioned for building and running applications in the cloud,” said Charles Fan, Sr. VP R&D, VMware.

Responding to Users

Version 9.1 delivers several features which users have been requesting for years, removing roadblocks to deploying new or ported applications on PostgreSQL. These include:

- Synchronous Replication for Clustering: enable high-availability with consistency
- Per-Column Collations: support linguistically-correct sorting per database, table or column.
- Unlogged Tables: greatly improves performance for ephemeral data 

"Heroku runs the largest PostgreSQL database-as-a-service in the world," said James Lindenbaum, Heroku co-founder. "The release of synchronous data replication with 9.1 provides our customers with innovative new ways of protecting mission-critical data, and validates PostgreSQL as one of the fastest-moving datastores available."

Advancing the State of the Art

Our community of contributors is innovating, delivering cutting-edge features which are new to the database industry. Some of these features are only available on PostgreSQL.

- K-Nearest-Neighbor Indexing: index on "distance" for faster spatial and text-search queries
- Serializable Snapshot Isolation: implements "true serializability" without blocking
- Writeable Common Table Expressions: execute complex multi-stage data updates in a single query
- Security-Enhanced Postgres: deploy military-grade security and mandatory access control 

"OpenERP has always relied on the enterprise-class features of PostgreSQL to provide a fast, reliable and scalable foundation for the Business Applications supporting our customers' operations every day. Data integrity in highly concurrent and transactional contexts is a critical topic for us, and we're very enthusiastic about the new Serializable Snapshot Isolation of PosgtreSQL 9.1!" said Olivier Dony, OpenERP Community Manager.

Extending the Database Engine

PostgreSQL's extensibility enables users to add new functionality to the database at runtime and use it for tasks no other database system can perform. Version 9.1 adds critical new extensibility features, including:

- Foreign Table Wrappers: attach and query other databases from PostgreSQL
- Extensions: easily create, load, and manage any of dozens of database extensions 

All of the above features, and more, are detailed on the What's New In 9.1 wiki page, as well as our release notes.

In PostgreSQL's 25th year of database development, our community continues to introduce new innovations with every annual release. Download version 9.1 now and experience the most advanced open source database system in the world.
