<a name="original_release"></a><h2>Original Press Release</h2>
<p><b>5 December 2006, Washington DC (LISA Conference):</b> The PostgreSQL Global Development
Group today announces the release of version 8.2 of the PostgreSQL
object-relational database management system. This 14th public release
adds features, maturity, and performance requested by business users,
delivering manageability comparable to leading enterprise database
systems.  Version 8.2 is expected to drive even more migrations
toward PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>"This release touches almost every command and database facility,"
said PostgreSQL core team member and EnterpriseDB database architect
Bruce Momjian. "It adds expanded, compatible syntax and interfaces
which have been requested by our community, making it easier for
new DBAs to fully use all of PostgreSQL's advanced features."</p>

<p>"Unisys is pleased to note significant enhancements in the scalability
and performance of PostgreSQL on large-scale multi-processor systems,"
states Ali Shadman, vice president and general manager, Open Source
Solutions, Systems and Technology, Unisys. "The newly released 8.2
version continues the maturation of PostgreSQL into a database
management system capable of enterprise adoption."</p>
<p>
New tools and features to make database management and development easier include:</p>

<p><b>Performance improvements:</b> version 8.2 improves performance around 20%
overall in high-end OLTP (online transaction processing) system tests.
Users can gain even more in data warehousing efficiency.  The changes include faster in-memory and on-disk sorting, better multi-processor scaling, better planning of partitioned data queries, faster bulk loads and vastly accelerated outer joins.</p>

<p><b>Warm Standby Databases:</b>  through an extension to our Point in Time Recovery
feature (introduced in version 8.0), administrators now can easily create a
failover copy of your database cluster.</p>

<p><b>Online Index Builds:</b> index builds can now occur while applications write to
database tables, allowing performance tuning without downtime.</p>

<p><b>SQL 2003 Features:</b>  PostgreSQL, well known for standards compliance,
has added syntax for several more features introduced in the ANSI
SQL 2003 specification, including: statistical aggregates, multi-row
VALUE statments, UPDATE RETURNING and multi-column aggregates.</p>

<p>Advanced database features, being offered in PostgreSQL 8.2 before any other
major database system, include:</p>

<p><b>Generalized Inverted Indexes:</b> support a more scalable and programmable
way of indexing semi-structured and full text data.</p>

<p><b>DTrace:</b>  PostgreSQL has also been instrumented for Solaris DTrace and
other advanced tracing tools via the Generic Monitoring Framework.</p>

<p>"With data warehouse instances housing billion-row tables and multiple
terabytes of data, online index builds and hot-standby capabilities
are crucial," said Theo Schlossnagle, Principal at OmniTI Computer
Consulting. "We are also excited that PostgreSQL is now a first-
class DTrace citizen.  This means our regular system analysis efforts
can now incorporate database-specific data leading to much more
meaningful results."</p>

<p>There are dozens of additional features and improvements in 8.2 which will
make PostgreSQL DBAs more productive.  See the press kit for details.

<p><b>About PostgreSQL:</b> PostgreSQL is the collective work of hundreds of developers, building on twenty-one years of development which started at the University of California, Berkeley. With its long-time support of an enterprise-level feature set including transactions, functions, triggers, and subqueries, PostgreSQL is being used by many of today's most demanding businesses and government agencies. PostgreSQL is distributed under a BSD license, which allows use and distribution without fees for both commercial and non-commercial applications.
</p>

<a name="additional_features"></a><h2>Additional Features in this Release</h2>
As well as the major features listed in the press release, there
are more than 200 new features and enhancements contributed by
dozens of developers for version 8.2. Among them are:
<ul>
<li>Advisory Locks: allow application-level database object control using
PostgreSQL's fast locking engine.</li>
<li>Selective pg_dump: permits drawing transactionally-consistent dumps of
sets of relations, selecting their inclusion/exclusion using regular
expressions.</li>
<li>Prepared Statements: has new administrative interfaces and performance improvements for prepared statements.</li>
<li>ISN/ISBN: this module, containing data types to support ISN product locators for inventory and retail systems, has been upgraded to support the latest international standards.</li>
<li>Cryptography: the pgcrypto module, supporting cryptography inside the database, has been updated with the latest algorithms.</li>
<li>SQL Enhancments: introducing new syntax, including UPDATE RETURNING, DROP IF EXISTS, ON COMMIT and new ownership and permissions commands, to make managing database objects on the command line easier.</li>
<li>PSQL Batch Selection: supports returning rows to the console in batches instead of all at once.</li>
<li>ECPG Refactor: the embedded PostgreSQL C interface has been extensively re-written and new interfaces added.</li>
<li>Major TSearch2 Improvements: UTF-8 support, thesaurus, query rewriting support and GIN indexing.</li>
<li>PL/Python: now supports named parameters and set returning functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>PostgreSQL's extensible architecture has led to a large community of
extensions such as additional procedural languages, interfaces
to external systems, new index types, and replication and high
availability tools that are hosted on <a href="http://www.pgfoundry.org">the official PostgreSQL community project site.</a>
Community projects that have made significant advances in the 8.2
release cycle include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Disjunctions: thanks to Google Summer of Code, PostgreSQL is the first database system to have an implementation of this radical new join algorithm.</li>
<li>PGPoolII: PGPool, under sponsorship from the Japanese Government, has added new load-balancing and partitioning capabilities</li>
<li>PL/Java: one of our two Java procedural languages has reached full production status, allowing full utilization of Java inside the database.</li>
</ul>

<a name="license"></a><h2>License</h2>
<p>
PostgreSQL uses the <a href="/about/licence">BSD license</a>,
which only requires that the licensed source code maintain its
copyright and licensing information. This
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">OSI-certified
license</a> is widely appreciated as flexible
and business-friendly, since it does not restrict the use
of PostgreSQL with commercial and proprietary applications. Together with
multi-company support and public ownership of the code,
the BSD license makes PostgreSQL very popular with vendors wanting to embed a database in
their own products without fear of fees, vendor lock-in, or changes in licensing terms.
